Definition 1. A formal system is a triple (L, A, R):
- L is a language (its words are formulae)
- A is a set of axioms (each axiom is a formula)
- R is a set of inference rules of form R1, ..., Rn |- R where R1, ..., Rn are called premises and R is called a conclusion.
Here, "|-" sign can be treated as "therefore".

Definition 2. A theorem is a formula obtained from applying the inference rules to the axioms. We'll denote the fact that F is a theorem as |-F.
Definition 3. An inference is a finite sequence of formulae F1, ..., Fn such that each of these is either an axiom or obtained from its predecessors via some inference rule.
Definition 4. Propositional calculus (PC) is a formal system (L, A, R):
- L is a language of propositional logic (PL)
- A is a set of axioms
- R is a set of PC inference rules (IR)
where A is defined via a single propositional axiom ~FvF, and IR set is defined as follows:
R1) F |- GvF - extension
R2) FvF |- F - reduction
R3) Fv(GvH) |- (FvG)vH - associativity
R4) FvG, ~FvH |- GvH - intersection

To prove that certain inference holds, we need to consecutively apply the inference rules until we see that the result is indeed correct.
For example, we can prove the commutativity rule "if |-AvB, then |-BvA" in the following way: we have |-AvB from our assumption, |-~AvA is an axiom, therefore we have |-BvA by the intersection rule.

Here is the list of some derived rules that might come in handy during exam:
R5) AvB |- BvA - commutativity
R6) A, A->B |- B - modus ponens
R7) (AvB)vC |- Av(BvC) - complete associativity

Theorem 1 (tautology theorem). The set of theorems and the set of tautologies are the same.
Corollary 1. If {A1, ..., An} |= A and |-A1, ..., |-An, then |-A.
Tautology theorem and its Corollary let us prove certain theorems without a need to provide inferences that are often hard to construct.
Instead, we try to prove (or disprove) some tautological consequence which truthness or falsehood then immediately tells us whether a theorem holds or not.
Example: "if |-AvC->BvD, then |-A->B and |-C->D". Assuming this holds, we should have AvC->BvD |= (A->B)&(C->D). For values A = C = D = T and B = F, we get AvC->BvD = T and (A->B)&(C->D) = F.
Hence, |= doesn't hold and neither does our presumed theorem.
