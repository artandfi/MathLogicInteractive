To show that formulae of type {F1, ..., Fn} |= F hold or not for any values of their terms, we can used a technique called resolution method.
Definition 1. We'll call a propositional formula of either form A or ~A a letter (literal). Such letters are called contrary to each other.
Definition 2. We'll call a propositional formula that is a disjunction of several letters a clausal sentence.
Definition 3. We'll call () - a clausal sentence with no letters - an empty clausal sentence. It is equivalent to the value of "false".

Resolution rule: suppose L in clausal sentence S and L' in clausal sentence S' are contrary. We'll call a disjunction D of all letters in S that are distinct from L and all letters from S' that are distinct from L'. We can say D is obtained via resolution rule: S, S' |- D.

The algorithm of the resolution method is as follows:
1. Append ~F to the left hand side of |= into a set of clausal centences in curly braces.
2. Consecutively apply the resolution rule to any applicable clausal sentences and results of such applicaitons.
3. If an empty clausal sentence was obtained, stop - this means that |= holds.
4. Otherwise, pick the values of the terms that show that |= does not hold for any values of the terms.
